- [On-Board Diagnostic Hand-Held Scan Tool Technology][6]
    - In  the  early  1980s,  automobile  manufacturers  began  using  electronics  and  on-board computers to control many of the engine functions.
   - In 1989, CARB issued regulations requiring the second generation of OBD regulations, often referred to as OBDII.
   - OBD systems on all 1994 and newer vehicles sold nationwide and known as Federal OBD.
   - SAE recommended practices (SAE J1978 and J1979) and the number of engine parameters available on OBD hand-held scan tools.
   -  Equipment  and  Tool Institute (ETI) 
   - SAE Requirements for OBD Scan Tools
      - J1962 - describes the standardized 16-pin trapezoidal connector
      - J1978 - describes the basic functions that an OBD Scan Tool will support
      - J1979 - describes diagnostic test modes for emission related diagnostic data
      - J1850,  ISO  9141-2  and  ISO  14230-4  -  describes  the  various  communication protocol
      - J2012 - describes the recommended standardization of numeric DTCs
